# Data Engineering Essentials

## Description:

This repository designed for the Data Engineering Fellowship program, providing essential resources and tools for building data pipelines.

This repository aims to cover a wide range of data engineering topics, from data ingestion and extraction to data transformation and loading.

In this repository, you will find examples of various data pipeline architectures and techniques, including: 
- Batch Processing, 
- Real-time Streaming,
- Distributed Computing. 
You will also find code snippets and templates to help you get started with popular data engineering tools such as `Hadoop`, `Apache Spark`, and `Apache NiFi.`

Whether you are a `beginner` or an `experienced data engineer`, [DE Essentials](https://github.com/DataOpsEnthusiast/Data_Engineering_Essentials) will provide you with the `knowledge` and `tools` you need to build robust and scalable data pipelines.
