# Load It Up! Historical, Full, and Incremental Data Loading Explained
In today's data-driven world, the ability to `collect,` `store,` and `analyze` large amounts of data is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions. However, with the sheer volume of data being generated on a daily basis, managing and processing this data can be a daunting task. That's where the concept of `data loads` comes into play. 

Let's take a closer look at the different types of data loads:
- Historical
- Full
- Incremental

## Historical Load:
It refers to loading all the `historical data` that is `available` from the `beginning` of a `system or process.` This type of load is usually done when `implementing a new system` or data warehouse, where all the data from the `past` is required for `accurate reporting` and `analysis.`

## Full Load:
It refers to loading all the data that is `available at the source system` or data warehouse to the `target system or data warehouse.` This type of load is done `periodically` to ensure that all the data is `up-to-date` in the target system.

## Incremental Load:
It refers to loading only the `new or changed data `from the `source system or data warehouse` to the `target system or data warehouse.` This type of load is done `frequently` to keep the target system updated with the latest data.
## A real-world scenario:
 consider a `retail company` that wants to `analyze its sales data` to identify `sales trends` and optimize its inventory. The company collects sales data from its `point-of-sale (POS) system` and stores it in a `data warehouse`. `Initially,` the company loads all the `historical sales data` from the `POS system` to the `data warehouse` using a `Historical Load.`

As the company `continues` to make sales, `new data` is generated and `stored` in the POS system. To ensure that the `data warehouse` has the `latest sales data,` the company performs `Incremental Loads daily,` loading only the `new or changed data` from the `POS system` to the `data warehouse.`

However, there may be situations where the `POS system` is `offline` or `unavailable` for a period of time. In such cases, the company may perform a `Full Load` to ensure that all the `missing data` is `loaded` into the `data warehouse.`
