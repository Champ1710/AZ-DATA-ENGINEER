# Introduction to Data Engineering
Data engineering is all about `collecting and organizing information`, or data, so that we can `make sense` of it. Think of it like organizing your `toys or books.` You might organize them by `color,` `size,` or `type,` so that you can `find` what you need `quickly and easily.` Data engineering is like `building a filing system` for all the `data we collect.` We also need a `place to store our data,` like a `computer or server.` It's important to collect `accurate data,` just like it's important to have the `right ingredients` in the `right amounts` to make a `cake.`
## What Data engineering is all about:

It is all about data, data repositories, data pipelines, data integration platforms, and big data. Moreover it is about the architecture of a data platform, the design considerations for a data store, how to extract, transform, and clean data to make it ready for analytics, and the principles of data security, privacy, and compliance regulations.

## Modern Data EcoSystem:
A modern data ecosystem includes:
- A network of interconnected entities.
- Entities in the ecosystem are independent and continually evolving.
- Data has to be integrated from disparate sources. 
- Different types of analysis and skills are required to generate insights.
- Active stakeholders collaborate and act on insights generated.
- Tools, applications, and infrastructure are required to store, process, and disseminate data as required.

## Availibility of Data:
Data is available in a variety of structured and unstructured:
- Datasets
- Residing in text
- Image
- Videos,
- Clickstreams
- User conversations
 - Social media platforms
- Ihe Internet of Things (or IoT) devices
- Real-time events that stream data
- Legacy databases 
- Data sourced from professional data providers and agencies.
## Working with Data:
The sources have never before been so diverse and dynamic. When you’re working with so many different sources of data, the first step is to `pull a copy` of the data from the `original sources` into a `data repository.` At this stage, you’re only looking at acquiring the data you need—working with data `formats, sources, and interfaces` through which this data can be pulled in. `Reliability, security, and integrity` of the data being acquired are some of the `challenges` you work through at this stage.

## Organizing and Cleaning Up Data for Effective Use:
After collecting data in a `common location,` it needs to be organized and optimized for use by people who need it. This involves making sure the `data meets standards` set by the organization, such as rules for handling personal information. It also involves following guidelines for keeping master data tables consistent across all systems used by the organization. Challenges at this stage include managing data and working with repositories that offer `reliability`, `flexibility`, `accessibility`, and `security`.

## Key Players in the Data Ecosystem:
In this Article we’re going to look at the role `Data Engineers,` `Data Analysts,` `Data Scientists,` `Business Analysts,` and `Business Intelligence Analysts` play in helping organizations tap into vast amounts of data and turn them into actionable insights. 
### It all starts with a Data Engineer.
`Data Engineers` are people who `develop and maintain` `data architectures` and make data `available` for `business operations and analysis.` 
Data Engineers work within the data ecosystem to
- Extract, integrate, and organize data from `disparate sources 
- Clean, transform, and prepare data
- Design, store, and manage data in data repositories.
They enable data to be `accessible` in `formats` and `systems` that the various `business applications`, as well as `stakeholders` like `Data Analysts` and `Data Scientists,` can `utilize.`

#### A Data Engineer must have good knowledge of:

- Programming
- Sound knowledge of systems and technology architectures,
- In-Depth understanding of relational databases and non-relational datastores.
### Now let’s look at the role of a Data Analyst.
In short, a Data Analyst `translates data and numbers` into `plain language,` so organizations can make decisions. 

#### Key Roles: 
- Inspect, and clean data for deriving insights; 
- Identify correlations, find patterns, and apply statistical methods to analyze and mine data;
- Visualize data to interpret and present the findings of data analysis. 

#### Analysts are the people who answer questions such as:

- “Are the users’ search experiences generally good or bad with the search functionality on our site” 

- “What is the popular perception of people regarding our rebranding initiatives” 
- “Is there a correlation between sales of one product and another." 

#### Data Analysts require good knowledge of:
- Programming skills
- Analytical and Story Telling Skills
- Spreadsheets 
- Writing queries,
- Using statistical tools to create charts and dashboards. 

### Let’s look at the role Data Scientists
Data Scientists `analyze data` for `actionable insights` and build `Machine Learning or Deep Learning models` that train on `past data` to create `predictive models.`

#### Data Scientists are people who answer questions such as:
- “How many new social media followers am I likely to get next month?” 
- “What percentage of my customers am I likely to lose to competition in the next quarter” 
- “Is this financial transaction unusual for this customer?”. 
#### Data Scientists require knowledge of
- Mathematics
- Statistics 
- Fair understanding of programming languages, 
- Databases, 
- Building data models.

### Then we also have Business Analysts and Business Intelligence Analysts.
Business Analysts `leverage` the work of `Data Analysts` and `Data Scientists` to look at `possible implications` for their business and the actions they need to take or recommend. 

Business Intelligence Analysts do the same, except their focus is on the `market forces` and `external influences` that `shape` their business. They provide business intelligence solutions by `organizing` and `monitoring` data on different business functions and exploring that data to extract insights and actionables that `improve business performance.`

 ## To summarize the Roles in simple terms:
- Data Engineering converts `raw data` into `usable data.`
- Data Analytics uses this data to `generate insights.` 
- Data Scientists use `Data Analytics` and `Data Engineering` to `predict` the `future` using data from the `past.`
 - Business Analysts and Business Intelligence Analysts use these `insights` and `predictions` to drive `decisions` that `benefit` and `grow` their `business.`
